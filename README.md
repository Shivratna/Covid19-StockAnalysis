## Getting the Data

For getting the data I utilized the IEX Cloud Services which provide Market Stocks related data for recent 15 Years. [ https://iexcloud.io/ ]

Utilised Pandas Datareader to get the data. I have collected stock information for the following banks:
* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

Basic implementations requirements :
1. Use datetime to set start and end datetime objects.
2. Figure out the ticker symbol for each bank.
2. Figure out how to use datareader to grab info on the stock.
